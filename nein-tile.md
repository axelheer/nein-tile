*A number game*

## Description

Another number game?

Yep. Join the numbers and feel the power of the math side.

If you like games like 1024, 2048, or the one and only *Threes!*, this one may be for you. And if you don't like them, who knows?

### Features

- Choose one of five different rule sets: Simple, Classic, Duality, Insanity, Fibonacci
- Choose a board size as you like: up to 12x12x12, or just 1x2x3, ...
- Yeah, you can join your numbers across three dimensions!
- Use an apprentice mode, it can be deterministic or not

### Rules

- Simple: a simple game conforms to the common 2048 game. Starting with 2 your quest is reaching 2048 at least by simply merging equal numbers together.
- Classic: a classic game conforms to the one and only 'Threes!' game. Starting with 1 and 2 your quest is reaching 12288 by merging equal numbers together, while handling evadable nice 'bonus' tiles, which turn out to be quite bothersome more often than not...
- Duality: a duality game requires you to handle two simple games within one, while 'bonus' tiles help you to double your results.
- Insanity: an insanity game requires you to handle two classic games within one, while 'bonus' tiles play havoc with your efforts.
- Fibonacci: a fibonacci game represents a nice variety using this famous sequence. Although the rules are mostly simple, your brain may need some practice in order to handle it properly...

### Dimensions

A game can be a cube with up to 12x12x12 sides, if your device can handle it. But being a cube ist not a requirement; just try 3x2x1, if you like. Beware: playing with only one layer may be a wise decision for starters...

### Options

Playing a deterministic game means undoing and redoing one and the same move leads to the same result, while during a non-determinstic game anything can happen. Disabling the apprentice mode means disabling the mighty undo button means being a true number warrior. Some like playing on a slippery surface, some prefer not; it's up to you.
